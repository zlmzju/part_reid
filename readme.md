## Instructions

- Use my [`Caffe`](https://github.com/zlmzju/caffe/tree/reid) for using triplet loss layer.

- Run the demo code [`demo/demo.ipynb`](demo/demo.ipynb) to see an example usage.

- Run `train.sh` in the `train` folder to train the model.

- The datasets are placed in the `dataset` folder, you can download the archived data from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0By55MQnF3PHCdlVZV0lTWV9Oejg).

## Descriptions

- Use `Caffe` for implementation, please refer to the [Caffe project website](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) for installation.

- The protocal file in `proto` folder is written in python.

- The actual training scripts and protocal files will be generated in the `train` folder.
